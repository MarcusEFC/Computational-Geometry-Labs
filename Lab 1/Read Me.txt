Computational Geometry Assignment 1 03/13/2016.

This program was written in C++.

In order to run this program:
1. Open terminal, and cd into where the program is located.
2. Make the program using the following command:
	
	make

3. Run the program using the following command:
	
	./viewPoints n
  
   where n can be substituted for some integer.

This program will generate n random points (as specified by the user), and determine the convex hull of the n randomly generated points. The number of points must be greater than or equal to 3.

You can test our program against test cases by pressing the following keys:

- 1: Reinitializes n random points and determines its convex hull

- 2: Reinitializes n random points in a star formation, and determines its convex hull (this test works best with more than 500 points)

- 3: Reinitializes n random points in a circle formation, and determines its convex hull

- 3: Reinitializes n random points in a line formation, and determines its convex hull

- q: This quits the program.
