Computational Geometry. Lab 5 - Shortest Path using Dijkstra and Visibility Polygon.

Authors: Marcus Christiansen, Konstantine Mushegian, Parker Hayes
based on the code provided by: Professor Laura Toma

Description: 
This program lets users create a set of obstacles in the space and specify the start and end points. The program then computes the shortest path from the start to end point.

Usage:
[I] -- clear everything and prepare for a new set of obstacles
[P] -- start making a new polygon. Press [p] and the click around
[O] -- once done, press [O] to save the newly created polygon and [P] to start making a new one
[S] -- place a start point
[F] -- place an end point
[E] -- after you're done placing start & end points, press [E], click anywhere the shortest path will be computed.
